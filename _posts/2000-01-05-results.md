Results for the two curriculum learning strategies: schedule sampling and frame skipping.  The addressed task is one-shot or semi-supervided video object segmentation, evaluated  on  the  car  class  in  the  validation  partition  of the [KITTI-MOTS benchmark](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_mots.php). The official metrics of the [MOTS challenge](https://motchallenge.net/workshops/bmtt2020/tracking.html) have been adopted.
