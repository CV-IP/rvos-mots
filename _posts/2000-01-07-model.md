This work has been developed with [RVOS](https://imatge-upc.github.io/rvos/), an recurrent neural network trained end-to-end for video object segmentation which is fast at inference time. The architecture of RVOS is based on an encoder-decoder. For the encoder, a pretrained model of ResNet-101 is used. The decoder is designed as an hierarchical recurrent architecture of Convolutional LSTMs. The cost function that is implemented is the Intersection over Union. RVOS is the fastest model for video object segmentation, able of processing more than 20 frames per second. This fact makes this model an ideal choice for addressing autonomous driving.
