*Video object segmentation can be understood as a sequence-to-sequence task that can benefit from the curriculum learning strategies for better and faster training of deep neural networks. This work explores different schedule sampling and frame skipping variations to significantly improve the performance of a recurrent architecture. Our results on the car class of the KITTI-MOTS challenge indicate that, surprisingly, an inverse schedule sampling is a better option than a classic forward one. Also, that a progressive skipping of frames during training is beneficial, but only when training with the ground truth masks instead of the predicted ones.*
