The model that has been used is the End-to-End Recurrent Network for Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), developed by researchers of three different entities: Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona Supercomputing Center and Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

RVOS' architecture is based on an encoder-decoder. For the encoder, a pretrained model of ResNet-101 is used. The decoder is designed as an hierarchical recurrent architecture of Convolutional LSTMs. The cost function that is implemented is the Intersection over Union. RVOS is the fastes model for video object segmentation, able of processing more than 20 frames per second. This fact makes this model an ideal choice for addressing autonomous driving.
